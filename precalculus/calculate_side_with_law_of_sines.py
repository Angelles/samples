# The purpose of this program is to calculate the unknown side length of a triangle, or x, based on the Law of Sines.
# In the Law of Sines, for a triangle, sin A/a = sin B/b = sin C/c.
# If the measure of angle A (in degrees) and side length a (the side opposite angle A) are known, and the measure
# (in degrees) of another angle, angle C, for example, is known, then the user can enter that information to get the
# length of side c and the measure of angle B.
