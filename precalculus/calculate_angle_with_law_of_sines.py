# The purpose of this program is to calculate the unknown measure of an angle in a triangle, or x, based on the
# Law of Sines. In the Law of Sines, for a triangle, sin A/a = sin B/b = sin C/c.
# If the measure of angle A (in degrees) and side length a (the side opposite angle A) are known, and length of another
# side, say side c, for example, is known, then the user can enter that information to get the measure of angle C.
