# Samples
This repo contains some of my writing and coding samples. Some are final, graded projects from my coursework.

## TaskList

The TaskList directory contains my final project for the Introduction to Programming in Java course I took in fall 2023. This project received an A. The project includes the program, which consists of a main class and a constructor class, and a technical design document. 

## Precalculus programs

I created the various Python programs for a couple of reasons:
- To better understand the math concepts
- To better understand how to write Python programs (to support my studies in an unrelated CS course)
- To check my results as I did practice problems while studying
