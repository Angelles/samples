# Apple Pie

The Apple Pie app is a word-guessing game. The user is presented with a screen containing a picture of a tree with apples on it and a series of blank spaces indicating where the letters should go. The user uses the built-in keyboard to make guesses.

If the user makes an incorrect guess, an apple falls from the tree. If all of the apples fall from the tree, the user loses that round. The loss is incremented and displayed in a tracker on the screen. If the user guesses the word correctly, the user wins that round. Wins are also incremented and displayed in the tracker.

Once the user has attempted all of the possible words (in the array in the code), the keyboard buttons are disabled and the game is finished. The user must restart the app to play again.

**Note:** I used Xcode Version 15.1 to build this app.
