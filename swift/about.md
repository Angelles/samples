# About Swift Projects

I completed the projects in this repository as part of an intro to Swift and iOS application development class. The class followed Apple Education's _Develop in Swift Fundamentals_ book. As part of the class, I leveraged Xcode's Interface Builder to complete the projects. The professor requested that we follow the project descriptions precisely. 

I received As on my projects and in the class as a whole.

## Projects in the Repository
The projects included in this repository include the following:
- Light
- Apple Pie
- Personality Quiz
  - I have included both the version I submitted that adhered strictly to the course requirements as well as "Angelle's Version," which includes quiz questions and answers that I wrote.
 
**Note:** I used Xcode Version 15.1 to create these projects.
