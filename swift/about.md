# Swift Projects

The projects I've included here are Introduction to Swift and App Development class projects; they are from Apple Education's *Develop in Swift Fundamentals* textbook. I used XCode to create them. XCode's Interface Builder produces high-quality user interfaces.

I have included the source code here because it is not possible to share actual iOS apps on GitHub.

## Light App

The Light App is a flashlight app that takes advantage of the intense level of brightness that iPhone screens can achieve. When the flashlight is off, the background color is black; when it is on, it is white.

## Apple Pie

Apple Pie is a word-guessing game built for the iPad. When the player guesses a letter that isn't in the word, an apple disappears from the tree. When all of the apples disappear, the loss count increments by one. If the player guesses the word before all the apples disappear, the win count increments by one.
