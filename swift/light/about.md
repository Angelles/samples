# Light App

The Light App provides users with a flashlight. The app's background switches to bright white when the user taps the screen. The iPhone's screen at maximum brightness level, along with the bright white background, provides illumination. Tapping the screen again switches the app's background back to black.

**Note:** I used Xcode Version 15.1 to build this app.
